# Donâ€™t Prolong Logins

A collection of methods to very quickly trigger some process and exit, so as to avoid hanging up a user login, policy, boot, log out, etc., while still allowing for the triggered process to be long and perhaps-unreliable.

Paltriness at present is due to my laziness amassing and redacting scripts.
