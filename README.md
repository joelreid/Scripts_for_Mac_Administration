# Scripts for Mac Administration

- Scripts mostly intended for use from a remote administration system.  
- Some weirdness may me sprinkled in due to their wildly-varying provenances and use-case histories.  
- Most also assume root privilege (if relevant) and may fail ungracefully without it.  
- Oh, and apologies as most are in bash. This is just for maximum readability and maintainability by the largest portion of my coworkers, whoever ends up inheriting this mess some day, and as an exercise for the reader (who no-doubt has a different favorite Real Programming Language™ from the author).
